This plugin provides an API with almost exact parity to the mail plugin.  Installing this plugin
replaces the sendMail injected method with it's own.  Doing so allows use of Postmark without
changing any code in your app or in the plugins your app depends on.

It does not support attachments as Postmark doesn't provide that capability.  If attachments
are used, it will be logged as an error and continue.
